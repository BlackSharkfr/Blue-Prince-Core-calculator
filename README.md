# Blue Prince - Core calculator
A small Terminal-UI application to solve a puzzle in the video game `Blue Prince`

Game official website [https://www.blueprincegame.com/]  
Steam : [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/]

This week-end project was mainly a pretext to learn how to create a Terminal UI application using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).
I am uploading this project following a [discussion on the steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1569580/discussions/0/599653842304370712/)
I will probably not update this project, ever.

Enjoy!
